*Overview*

This repository consists of all projects done as part of Udacity's Product Manager nanodegree. I have taken the case study of LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network on the internet. The idea is to expand its job market offerings by creating an app that will recommend the best jobs to recent college graduates based on their skills and preferences. 

Throught the program I learned to:
- Pitch a product vision 
- Run a design sprint
- Managed a product development process
- Laucn a product to the market
